The files found here in are from Gor Nishanov CppCon2017 talk: Naked coroutines live (with networking).

There were some tweaks that were needed in a couple of files so they would compile.  Also I added a couple of examples from the slides (even though they were not directly coroutine related) for completeness.

Most of the files can be found in their original state at: https://github.com/GorNishanov/await/tree/master/2017_CppCon/live.
